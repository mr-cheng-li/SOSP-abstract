\section{Our Proposal}
In this section, we will propose two new techniques to eliminate the cross-log dependencies, which will accelerate the logging and recovery.
\subsection{Vector Clock vs Lamport's Clock}
The order is defined in [] by Lamport's clock, which is a global total order and will incur unnecessary false dependeicies. For example, the right side of Fig.~\ref{fig:vectorclock} shows the Lamport's Clock in distributed Log, each block indicates one log entry. When H wants to commit, all of the changes before it must be flushed to disk even though some of them are indenpendent with each other, this kind of dependency is called false dependency and will incur performance slow down.

We can adopt Vector Clock to avoid the false dependency, whose order is partial, the left side of Fig.~\ref{fig:vectorclock} illustrates the Vector Clock in distributed Log. When H wants to commit, only the really dependent log entries are flush to disk, so we can flush part of the Logs rather than almost all of them.

\subsection{Conflict-free Replicated Data Types}
We can make some conflict operations commutative by using Conflict-free Replicated Data Types(CRDTs), which means that the result will be consistent even though commute the order of related operations. We give a simple example to propose our method. In the left side of Fig.~\ref{fig:crdt}, transaction 2(txn2) and 4(txn4) want to modify the same object A, and txn2 operates \texttt{A = A * 2}, then txn4 operates \texttt{A = A + 4}, the final result of A is 10. But if we commute the operations of txn2 and txn4, the result will be 14 and inconsistent. 

If we transfer the multiplication into addition such as the example in Fig.~\ref{fig:crdt} right side, the operation \texttt{A = A * 2} can be transferred as \texttt{A = A + 3}, we can issue operations of txn2 and txn4 without order to improve performance and the result will be always consistent.

%   \item \textbf{Remove} Remove a specific correlation item from a file.
% \end{itemize}
% \textbf{Challenge 1} When there is overwritten to a file, as Fig.~\ref{fig:overwrite} shows, the new data is easy to make a analysis to find correlated files. But the overlayed data maybe contain links to related files, which are obsolete and should be removed simultaneously. However the covered data isn't in cache, so how to update the correlations is a challenge. We introduce a lazy update method. When a files overwrites, we make a \texttt{overwritten} tag on the file. Once the tagged file is accessed, system will make a semantic analysis again to rebuild correlations to keep consistency.
