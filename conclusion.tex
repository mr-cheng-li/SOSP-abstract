\section{Conclusion and Future Work}

In this paper, we give a presentation of correlations among files from the views of files data and access pattern. We define the correlations and support three methods to update them via online, offline and client-defined. Based on these correlations, we propose a approach to prefetch related metadata to reduce IOs traffic to MDS and increase client cache hit ratio. And we are building a prototype system to evaluate performance.

In the future, we are plan to conduct diverse experiments to compare our approach with other methods on IOs to MDS, client cache hit ratio and memory overhead. Meanwhile, we expect exploring correlations from other views, like clients and namespace to present a extensive view to correlations.
