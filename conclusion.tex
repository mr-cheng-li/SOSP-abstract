\section{Conclusion and Future Work}

In this paper, we propose a new version of distributed Log by leveraging Vector Clock and CRDTs to eliminate cross-log dependencise, which can be processed by multiple threads simultaneously so as to speed up the logging and recovery and support high level applications better. We'd like to run some experiments to make our motivations steady by first, then consider the further utilization of multi-core such as CPU-affinity to optimized our distributed Log and implement our key ideas in a real system.
